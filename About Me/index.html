            <p>Hi everyone. Let me introduce myself. My name is Stephane. I am 23 years old. I am from Cape Verde. My hobbies are: watching animes, movies, and series. Since I was a child, I have been passionate with technology and everything related to technology. I still do not know if I want to pursue Web design and development as a career. I am undecided between software development and Web development. I am taking this course (WDD 130 Web Fundamentals) because it will allow me to understand the basics of web design and development. With these knowledge, I will be able to have a pretty good idea of which career path is the best for me. I look forward to work with you.</p>
